Face-detection App, Front End.
Built with React.

Backend: https://github.com/laver0ck/face-detecion

Deployed app: https://face-smart-detect.herokuapp.com/
Bear in mind, that it is deployed using free-tier, so the app goes in standby mode after 30 minutes of inactivity. 
It takes about 20-30 seconds to wake it up.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
